Development Process

First I opened a new document on the Notepad ++ software and started incorporating the content of the page as it was described in 
the document that was sent to me, marking each element with its corresponding tag as I saw fit. Also in this part of the process 
I put all of the images in a new folder wich I named "Imagens". I then created the CSS document and linked the HTML code to it, 
also, I linked all of the CSS and JS documents necessary to apply the Bootstrap framework. I tried to emulate the heading of the 
already existing website because I believe these were the instructions. I was not able to identify all of the fonts appearing in 
the heading, such as the logo's, but I feel that Helvetica was a close enough combination. The items for the main menu are hidden 
in commentary because unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to make them be not visible when the menu isn't being used. 
Everything that is in <body> is marked as fluid to make the entire page responsive. With that part finished, I moved on to the 
main part of the test, typesetting the content. I used two columns, on the right side are the quotes and the company's 
information, and on the left are the rest of the content.
